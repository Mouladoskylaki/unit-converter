Canonical Tags: If the content on these pages is 
very similar (since it's mostly conversion logic), consider using canonical tags
 to avoid duplicate content issues. This tells search engines that one 
 version of the page is the primary one,
 and other versions should be treated as copies.

Content Uniqueness: Ensure that each page has unique, 
high-quality content that gives users more than just the conversion tool. 
You might add a brief explanation of the conversion or additional context 
to make each page more valuable and reduce the risk of them being seen as 
low-quality or duplicate content.

Internal Linking: Ensure you add internal links between these specific 
pages (e.g., from the homepage or the "category list" below). This helps spread link 
equity across your website and makes it easier for search engines to find all the relevant pages.
